# Initial Try

Can you fix the method call in the first print statement so that it prints `person1`'s age?

Can you fix the method call with 16 to properly change the age of `person1` to 16?

Add to the second print statement to see the updated age of `16` get printed out for `person1`.

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
